      <description>Introduction What follows is an analysis of Yelp reviewed businesses in Berlin, Germany. It can broadly be broken up into two parts: The first part constitutes a general EDA where I explore the contours of the data and produce some basic statistics. The second part represents an attempt to describe each of Berlin’s 12 districts through “characteristic” businesses.
This blogpost represents a couple of firsts. For one, it is the product of of my very first foray into the world of geospatial data, including maps, decimal degrees, dot density plots, choropleth maps (not included below, but coming soon), etc.</description>

      <description>This website is my personal hompage and blogfolio. I put mostly data-science-related content here, because that&amp;rsquo;s my passion, but sometimes I also write about other things.
Because this is a blog cum portfolio you will often find prose interspersed with code. This is known as literate programming, and I hope it encourages readers/data scientists to learn from, teach, and otherwise interact with me.
The site is built with Hugo—a static site generator made with Go.</description>
