      <description>This website is my personal hompage and blogfolio. I put mostly data-science-related content here, because that&amp;rsquo;s my passion, but sometimes I also write about other things.
Because this is a blog cum portfolio you will often find prose interspersed with code. This is known as literate programming, and I hope it encourages readers/data scientists to learn from, teach, and otherwise interact with me.
The site is built with Hugo—a static site generator made with Go.</description>
