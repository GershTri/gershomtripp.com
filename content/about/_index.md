[Hallihallo](https://www.dict.cc/deutsch-englisch/Hallihallo.html), and welcome to my website! I'm Gershom. Originally from the USA, I study psychology at Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin and moonlight as a data scientist. I mostly use R, but I also have some experience with Python. Check out my blog to see what I'm up to.

I co-organize a data science co-learning meetup at [Co.up](http://co-up.de/) in Kreuzberg for [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/). You can find us on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/).

I also do some audio and video editing, some web stuff, and I occasionally teach English to adults, where I use my data science and psych skills to optimize learning. When I'm not programming I enjoy vigorous exercise, non-fiction, thoughtful movies, languages (programming and natural), and hummus. I'm also a bit of a productivity nut (GTD 4evr!), and I've recently discovered a passion for mnemonics and mental math.

I live in Kreuzberg, Berlin, with my charming wife and her many [puppets](http://bubales.de/).
