<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What follows is an analysis of Yelp reviewed businesses in Berlin, Germany. It can broadly be broken up into two parts: The first part constitutes a general EDA where I explore the contours of the data and produce some basic statistics. The second part represents an attempt to describe each of Berlin’s 12 districts through “characteristic” businesses.</p>
<p>This blogpost represents a couple of firsts. For one, it is the product of of my very first foray into the world of geospatial data, including maps, decimal degrees, dot density plots, choropleth maps (not included below, but coming soon), etc.</p>
<p>It’s also my first largish independent project. I’ve been coding for a while now, and I’ve done countless EDA’s, but I have not yet compiled my findings in a document that is meant to be read by others - look at Mr. Optimistic, assuming people are going to read this!</p>
<p>And finally, it’s my first blogpost ever. I’ve taken David Robinson’s <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">advice</a> and set up my own blog cum portfolio, and I intend to add to it regularly. Hopefully the internets will treat me kindly.</p>
<p>I can’t claim the idea for this post as my own. I’ve take quite a lot of inspiration from Amber Thomas’ and Ilia Blinderman’s <a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/03/neighborhoods/"><strong>A Tail of Two Cities</strong></a>, where they did a similar (and much cooler) analysis of Seattle and NYC. They, in turn, were inspired by Katie Hempenius’ <a href="https://katiehempenius.com/post/yelp-map-of-san-francisco/">analysis</a> of San Francisco’s Yelp reviews. I highly recommend both analyses.</p>
<p>Note that I frequently use the term <em>district</em> in place of <em>neighborhood</em>.</p>

<h2>Getting the Data</h2>
<hr />
<p>The data were collected using the official Yelp <a href="https://www.yelp.de/developers/documentation/v3"><em>Fusion</em></a> API. Yelp’s API isn’t really made for bulk downloading data, although this is allowed for non-commercial analyses such as the one you have before you, so there are a couple of request limits to contend with. There might be a more refined solution, but what worked for me was to divide Berlin into a grid of 500x500 meter blocks and then “scan” Berlin from top to bottom and left to right.</p>
<p>This method, although effective, did have one unforeseen pitfall: The data developed very regular vertical striations (e.g. in a dot density map) in the southern part of the grid, and particularly in the southeast. After a moment of frustration I hit on the idea that longitudinal lines don’t run parallel, they converge at the poles and spread as they approach the equator, so the same longitudinal coordinates represent different distances at different latitudes. Consequently, the search radius should be increased incrementally as the scan moves south.</p>
<p>This strategy, being more ax than scalpel, generates <strong>a lot</strong> of duplicates. After removing them I ended up with 11989 unique listings for Berlin and Potsdam, the latter of which is a small city just outside of Berlin.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, the number of unique listings for Berlin and Potsdam is just under 12,000. The 17,976 you see here is due the fact that some listings belong to multiple categories. I haven’t been able to discern any kind of consistent hierarchy (i.e. supercategories and subcategories), so every</p>
<p>A dot density plot can give some perspective on the overall distribution of Yelp-reviewed businesses at the district and city level. The colors correspond to Berlin’s 12 administrative districts and Potsdam, a town to the southwest of Berlin. Knowing exactly which color corresponds to which district isn’t important at this point. It’s enough to realize that most business are concentrated in and around the city center, and that some districts obviously have more, and more geographically concentrated businesses.</p>

<p>While the dot density plot looks cool and gives us some insight into the distribution of all businesses in Berlin, it’s not very efficient at showing the differences between districts. For that I’ll resort to the humble bar plot.</p>
<p>The following plot shows the absolute business count for each Berlin district. The districts with the highest number of businesses - Mitte, Panow, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, etc. - correspond to the densest clusters we saw in the previous dot density chart, and those with the lowest number correspond to the outer, more residential districts</p>

<h2>Deciding on a Metric</h2>
<p>Ilia Blinderman and Amber Thomas <a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/03/neighborhoods/">rely</a> on Katie Hempenius’s “incidence rate” metric from her <a href="https://katiehempenius.com/post/yelp-map-of-san-francisco/">analysis</a> of San Francisco’s neighborhoods, so I will address Katie’s arguments directly. I recommend reading Katie’s post for a complete understanding of how she arrived at her metric, but we might summarize her reasoning thusly:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
X = \frac{category_{Z}\;in\;district_{X}}{category_{Z}\;in\;city} \times
\frac{businesses\;in\;city}{businesses\;in\;district_{X}}
\]</span></p>
<p>I have a number of complaints regarding this metric, ranging from minor to major. I’ll deal with two issues first that I regard as minor since they really have no bearing on Katie’s, Ilia’s, and Amber’s conclusions. Still, I think they are worth briefly discussing, if only for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p>My first complaint has to do with terminology. Simply put, the above formula does not represent the incidence rate. The <em>incidence rate</em> has a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section2.html">specific meaning</a>, particularly in epidemiology, but also in the business realm. It is namely a measure of <em>new cases</em> in a specified period of <em>time</em>. Time is not, however, factored into the above formula. In reality, this formula is more of a riff on <em>prevalence</em>, which gives us the proportion of existing cases in the population as a whole. Here our population consists of all city-wide members of category<sub>Z</sub>, and our cases are any members of category<sub>Z</sub> found in district<sub>X</sub>. From here on out I’ll refer to this prevalence as prevalence<sub>CC</sub> (to be contrasted with prevalence<sub>CB</sub>, which I shall discuss shortly).</p>
<p>I would like to add that using the incidence rate in this way is, although not really correct, also perfectly understanable. <em>Incidence</em> is, after all, commonly used to indicate the <em>occurence</em> of something. In fact, most dictionary <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/incidence">definitions</a> reflect just this usage, and incidence, occurence, and prevalence are frequently treated as <a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/incidence">synonyms</a>. Nevertheless, the incidence rate has a more specific meaning than incidence alone, and since an <em>epidemiology of Yelp-reviewed businesses</em> sounds like a perfectly reasonable approach, I think it’s worth splitting a few hairs here.</p>
<p>An even less pressing issue, but perhaps relevant in terms of computational resources, is the second half of the equation, which helps to “normalize for the effects of commercial versus residential usage”, as Katie puts it. This step normalizes the prevalences<sub>c/c</sub> by scaling them upwards by an amount equal to the number of times larger the city-wide business population is than each district’s respective business population. That means districts with fewer businesses receive a greater boost, so their prevalences<sub>c/c</sub> can be compared directly with those of districts with more businesses.</p>
<p>The following exampl should hopefully make things clearer, while also offering a basis for my objection. The data is for two districts of a hypothetical city. Many of the column names should be more or less self-explanatory once you understand the basic abbreviations: Districts = <code>dist</code>, businesses = <code>bus</code>, categories = <code>cat</code>, total = <code>tot</code>.</p>
<p>The first table simply shows the category members and total businesses at the district and city level:</p>

<p>The second table includes the calculations we can make from the first table’s data. Particularly important are the columns <code>cat_dist/cat_city</code>, which shows us the prevalence<sub>CC</sub>, and <code>(c_d/c_c)*(b_c/b_d)</code>, which shows the <em>normalized</em> prevalence<sub>CC</sub>:</p>

<p>We should notice a couple of things here. First, normalizing the prevalences<sub>c/c</sub> allows us to compare the between-district, within-category rankings, e.g. we can see that C<sub>1</sub> is equally prevalent in D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> once we control for differences in the total number of businesses in each district. On the other hand, the within-district, between-category rankings remain unaffected.</p>
<p>And therein lies the crux of the problem: Katie, Ilia, and Amber appear to have only used the within-district, between-category rankings to characterize their cities’ districts, which means normalizing the data in this way was unnecessary. Ergo, a simplified version of Katie’s formula would work just as well:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
X = \frac{category_{Z}\;in\;district_{X}}{category_{Z}\;in\;city}
\]</span></p>
<p>To be clear, I don’t mean to imply that between-district rankings are unimportant. On the contrary, I’ve implemented it as part of my own proposed method below. It is also fully possible that I’ve missed something. Katie’s code doesn’t seem to be available, and Ilia and Amber’s data has already been thoroughly processed, so it’s impossible to replicate some necessary steps without downloading all the Yelp data they used, which is more work than I’m prepared to do right now. If you happen to find some mistakes in my reasoning, please feel free to point them out in the comments.</p>
<p>With the minor issues cleared up, we can now turn to the what I see as the major drawbacks of the prevalence<sub>CC</sub>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>It ignores differences in total business frequency</strong>. If 10 of 20 city-wide members of category C<sub>1</sub> are found in a district, and 100 of 200 city-wide members of category C<sub>2</sub> are found in the same district, then prevalence<sub>CC</sub> tells us that the neighborhood is equally characterized by C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> (10/20 = 0.5 and 100/200 = 0.5). Even worse, if C<sub>2</sub> has 210 instead of 200 city-wide members, then the formula tells us that C<sub>1</sub> characterizes the neighborhood <em>better</em> than C<sub>2</sub>, even though C<sub>2</sub> occurs 10 times more than C<sub>1</sub> in the district!</li>
<li><strong>It is biased in favor of small sample sizes</strong>. Different types of businesses likely aren’t distributed evenly across a city. Especially small populations of niche businesses might be more likely be clustered in one area. For example, vegan restaurants might be fairly rare in the city as a whole, but in one particulary trendy neighborhood you might find a cluster of them. As is the nature of things, “trendy” neighborhoods are often also gentrifying inner-city areas with large minority communities. If the minority population is dispersed throughout the rest of the city at a rate greater than the vegan restaurants, then the above formula would suggest that the neighborhood is better characterized as “vegan” than as Black, Latino, Arabic, Indian, etc. even if these communities and cultures are far more prominent in everyday life. Of course, it’s still important to know that there are more vegan restaurants in one neighborhood than anywhere else, but neighborhood’s uniqueness should not be determined primarily by the general scarcity of some of its businesses. (Note: This principle holds true for any businesses. My example h)</li>
<li><strong>It doesn’t take into account variations in the total number of businesses</strong>. Two neighborhoods might both be home to 20 of 100 total category members, i.e. each has 20% of the whole, but neighborhood <em>x</em> has a total of 2,000 businesses, while neighborhood <em>y</em> only has 200. Should we say that the category characterizes both neighborhoods equally? Probably not.</li>
<li><strong>It ignores other indicators of interest</strong>. It would be reasonable to view the number of listings for a given category in a district as one indication of interest. For example, if we assume that two districts D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> have, in reality, the same number of instances of C<sub>x</sub>, but there are more Yelp listings for that category in D<sub>1</sub> than in D<sub>2</sub>, then we could hypothesize C<sub>x</sub> generates more interest in D<sub>1</sub> than in D<sub>2</sub>, and that it thus characterizes D<sub>1</sub> better than D<sub>2</sub>. But what if the C<sub>x</sub> listings in D<sub>2</sub> have more reviews on average?</li>
</ol>
<p>With the above</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
score = 
prevalence_{CB} \times
prevalence_{CC} \times
interest
\]</span> Each part of this formula brings its own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, prevalence might tell us what occurs the most, but it doesn’t tell us anything about less prevalent businesses that might still be important in some other way, e.g. in terms of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
score = 
\left(
    \frac{category_{zip}}{businesses_{zip}} - 
    \frac{category_{city}}{businesses_{city}}
\right) \times
\frac{category_{zip}}{category_{city}} \times
\frac{reviews_{mean/zip}}{reviews_{mean/city}}
\]</span></p>
<p>I’ll refer to the first part as the <em>relative prevalence</em>, since it is a measure of district-level prevalence relative to the city-level prevalence. I’ve chosen to use the relative prevalence, instead of just the district-level prevalence, because it is a better indicator of how the district is different from the city as a whole. It also offers a handy cut-off: Anything less than 0 is less prevalent in the district than in the city, and anything more than 0 is more prevalent in the district than in the city. It’s then just a matter of sorting the relative prevalences from greatest to least to find the categories that are overrepresented in the district.</p>
<p>As a virtuous programmer (I try 🤷) I’ll attempt to zero in on a good solution via edge cases, which I can formulate in a series of what-ifs:</p>
<p>Dropping categories with small sample sizes (Ilia and Amber set a threshold of 1% of a district’s businesses) ignores the issue posed by <em>1.</em>, i.e. that a neighborhood might be characterized by a small number of unusual businesses, or perhaps a single, very large institution.</p>
<p>I think most of the confusion here stems from the fact that specific epidemiological terminology is being used in a context where an epidemological approach is perfectly valid, but how the terminology is being used isn’t quite right.</p>
<p>Using the proportion <code>category in district/category in city</code> can be misleading.</p>
